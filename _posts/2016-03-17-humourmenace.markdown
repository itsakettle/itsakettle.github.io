There are many pubs in Dublin with great social histories. My family has always gone to one pub in particular and behind the bar there is a plaque

**A bird is known by its song, a man by their conversation**

I first read these words in my late teens and they stayed with me, a social axiom - Personality is King - surfacing now whenever I talk to somebody. 

Personality is probably characterised most by humour and I want to focus on one of its necessary ingredients - menace without malice or _pretend menace_. 

## Pretend Menace

How can you *slag*, *take the micky*, *burn* or *mock* without a little bit of menace.  At the very least you need to understand it, you need to be able to simulate it. How do we know it's pretend? Well I think we just know real menace when we see it, like how we can tie our shoe laces without thinking or how we know that someone is sad or in a grump by just looking at their face.

Let's imagine for a second that there is a menace spectrum. On the blue side we have being nice and on the red we have being mean. As you move from blue to red you move from nice to mean. In the middle there is a big grey area.

At the risk of trying to deconstruct humour let's try to plot a simple joke on the menace spectrum, specifically a _your mama_ joke...

Jokes like this are mean and insulting but at the same time it could just be banter, so it slots nicely into the grey area.

## OCD and Menace

A very common form of OCD is harm OCD. People who suffer from this are afraid that they will do physical or emotional harm to others. Very importantly they never ever cause harm nor do they want to. **Intrusive thoughts** combine with **thought action fusion**, causing the person to feel like doing harm is only moments away all day long. When you suffer from this form of OCD the last thing you want to be associated with is menace, even _pretend menace_!

Through the lense of harm OCD, the menace spectrum is much different. There is a clear line that separates nice from mean. There is no such thing as a little bit of menace, you are nice or you are mean. Moreover this line will most likely be closer to the Nice side i.e. it is more likely that you will see the mean in things that you could say or do. So when you suffer from harm OCD the menace spectrum actually looks something like this:

<div align="centre" >

</div>

and when the joke is mapped onto this we get:

<div align="centre" >
	<img src="/assets/img/foffocd/personality/ocd menace spectrum joke.png" alt="ocd menace spectrum joke"  />
</div>

With harm OCD this joke is too far, it crosses the line. You think of the joke but it appears too mean and you decide not to say anything.

## Higher Moral Standard

Another characteristic of OCD is present here. Holding yourself to **too high a moral standard**. If you and a friend both make the same joke then you will view their joke on a different spectrum to yours.

	<img src="/assets/img/foffocd/personality/me everyone else.png" alt="me everyone else"  />
</div>

So if someone suffering from OCD hears a friend make the joke they deemed too mean to tell, it is unlikely they would judge their friend, or hold their friend as accountable as they would hold themself. This is continuous self censorship leading to withdrawal from conversation after conversation. How can a person with OCD be themselves around even their closest friends and family? If your OCD makes you be quiet, how can you show your personality?


## Recovery

Recovering from OCD is entirely possible. OCD-UK has a summary of treatments <a href="http://www.ocduk.org/ocd-treatments"> here</a>. Sufferers often wonder what recovery looks like and maybe the diagrams above are a good way to visualise it.

Treatment is about learning to accept intrusive thoughts through exposure. For example thinking something awful, running the (imaginary) risk that harm will occur and feeling temporary but extremely unpleasant anxiety. It's really important that compulsions are not acted upon while experiencing the anxiety.  This is very difficult at first requiring tenacity and bravery but it gets easier quicker than you might think. 

The anxiety will reduce naturally and the thoughts are gradually seen for what they are - just thoughts - and the brain recalibrates its understanding of nice and mean. As this happens the boundary on the spectrum moves a little bit towards the centre. Over time and multiple exposures the spectrum boundary moves to its healthy position and the spectrum gradually blurs.
