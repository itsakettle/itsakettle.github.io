Reach for a cup, pet the dog, scratch one foot with the other foot, yawn, smile, blink.  

We don't think about a lot of the things we do. We make the decision and our body does the rest. Our brain says

> I've got a procedure for that, it's an incredibly complex combination of muscle memory and brain chemistry, but you won't even notice, I'll run it in the background.

Sometimes we don't even make the decision and another conscious layer seems to do it for us. I rarely schedule in blinking time - unless I have been staring at a computer for hours - some actions are just completely automatic. Autopilot is a real time saver. It can do the thinking and the doing. Great.

I'm hoping that the concept of _AutoPilot_ is familiar to everybody. So here I am going to try to describe it in an intuitive way and then show how OCD makes it something to be feared rather than trusted.

### AutoPilot

Let's look at a really simple concept for how _AutoPilot_ works. Say it has two components - the thinking component _ThinkPilot_ and the doing component _DoPilot_. _ThinkPilot_ comes up with the thoughts and passes them to _DoPilot_ to carry out. So things look a little like this:

<div align="center" >
	<img src="assets/img/foffocd/autopilot/autopilot_ThinkDo1.png" alt="AutoPilot_ThinkDo1"  />
</div>


_ThinkPilot_ generates thoughts randomly but it gets some inputs as well that direct the randomness. Keeping things simple let's say the inputs are

* the person's _personality_
* their current _mood_
* some situational _context_ 

So the diagram above becomes a bit richer and looks like this:

<div align="center" >
	<img src="/assets/img/foffocd/autopilot/autopilot_ThinkDo2.png" alt="AutoPilot_ThinkDo2"  />
</div>

So as an example let's talk about Jenny who works for (the fictitious) Woof Transport Inc. in product development. Jenny is

* the _office joker_ 
* in a _bad mood_ 
* _giving her big presentation on a new dog bicycle proposal but she can't remember what comes next_ 

Let's push this example into _ThinkPilot_ and see what comes out.

<div align="center" >
	<img src="/assets/img/foffocd/autopilot/autopilot_ThinkDo3.png" alt="AutoPilot_ThinkDo3"  />
</div>

So the office joker Jenny is having a bad day and has certainly been in better form. She is midway through her big presentaton and suddenly she goes blank. Panic? No. _ThinkPilot_ reads the situation perfectly and before she knows it Jenny is executing the perfect Gripping Pause giving herself time to recover. Very composed.

Of course sometimes _ThinkPilot_ isn't so polished:

<div align="center" >
	<img src="/assets/img/foffocd/autopilot/autopilot_ThinkDo4.png" alt="AutoPilot_ThinkDo4"  />
</div>

In this scenario _ThinkPilot_ doesn't deliver and there are consequences. Jenny inadvertently shows the audience her inbox and in particular emails to her boyfriend giving out about her boss's ineptitude. Yikes.

_ThinkPilot_ can also just be absurd. 

<div align="center" >
	<img src="/assets/img/foffocd/autopilot/autopilot_ThinkDo5.png" alt="AutoPilot_ThinkDo5"  />
</div>

This time in the throws of panic Jenny gets the urge to bark like a dog. The whole company would think she has lost it, that she can't hack the pressure of presenting and that she is unprofessional. However, _DoPilot_ comes to the rescue, and in this instance knows not to do anything. Jenny just stands there, and soon _ThinkPilot_ comes up with a more reasonable idea.

So as we all know _DoPilot_ is clever enough to _filter_ out anything absurd. However maybe this doesn't fit too well into this hypothetical framework we have set up. It probably makes more sense for this _filter_ to be another component, rather than being contained within _DoPilot_. Welcome _FilterPilot_! Our _AutoPilot_ model now looks like this:

<div align="center" >
	<img src="/assets/img/foffocd/autopilot/autopilot_ThinkDo6.png" alt="AutoPilot_ThinkDo6"  />
</div>

_ThinkPilot_ is essentially a random thought generator but no absurd automatic thoughts are acted upon because of _FilterPilot_. Barking like a dog in the middle of a big presentation might not be great for Jenny's career, but what if the thought is more sinister like

> Throw a pen at the person nearest to me.

or 

> Tell everyone to Fuck Off.

These thoughts are malicious and unwanted but research shows that all human beings have these sort of thoughts from time to time. _FilterPilot_ covers this as well. It understands who we are and what we are about and efficiently figures out what thoughts are in line with our moral makeup. So these **intrusive thoughts** are never acted upon.

### OCD and AutoPilot

Sufferers of OCD are prone to a pyschological process known as **Thought Action Fusion**. This is where a person _feels_ that thinking something is the same as actually doing it. 

<div align="center" >
	<img src="/assets/img/foffocd/autopilot/autopilot_ThinkDo7.png" alt="AutoPilot_ThinkDo7"  />
</div>

This is very upsetting when it comes to automatic and unwanted thoughts. For instance the thought might be to push somebody in front of a bus after which the person with OCD will check several times that the person in front of them at the bus stop is still alive! The reality is that the thought is harmless with millions of people having it everyday. The problem is that the sufferer can't see this and attaches undeserved meaning to the thought.

> If I thought it, I must have done it.


They spend most of their time feeling like a monster.

So what is the effect of Thought Action Fusion on _AutoPilot_? It's simple, you stop trusting _FilterPilot_. It definitely still works (otherwise a lot of people would be pushed in front of buses everyday) but as far as you are concerned all the crazy, weird or malice stuff that _ThinkPilot_ comes up with will go straight through to _DoPilot_ which will do as it is told. This means that Jenny might actually think that she barked during her presentation. She's saying

> We project one million Dog Bicycles will be sold by Christmas

but in her head all she hears is

> Bark bark bark bark bark bark bark bark bark bark woof

_AutoPilot_ is no longer a time saver but something to be monitored each moment of everyday. Every involuntary thought and movement has to be remembered, scrutinised and analysed for fear that some terrible act has been committed. 
The _Pilot_ spends all their time checking what the _AutoPilot_ is doing. Soon _Autopilot_ is pretty much obsolete. Every action is thought about. The day is exhausting.

So when without even thinking you reach for a cup, pet the dog, scratch one foot with the other foot, yawn, smile or blink - have a think about your _AutoPilot_ and tell it how much you trust it.
