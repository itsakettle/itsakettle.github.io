Everyone seems to talk about *moments*. Somebody spills their coffee

> Sorry I had a bit of a moment!

A groom giving his wedding speech

> When I first saw Kelly she was dancing to Purple Rain...I'll never forget that moment!

I want to try to use a simple concept of *moments* to describe how OCD can take over your day.

## Moments as a Concept

For each person every day is filled with time - 24 hours of it - but every second isn't treated the same. We aren't very good at tracking each of the 86,400 seconds in a day, so instead we subconsciously group them. 

Let's talk about Mark, a designer who works for the Great Design Company. Say his plan for the day is to get up, go to work, come home and relax and then go to bed. Then he might think of his day like below.

<div align="center" >

</div>

So of the 86,400 seconds in the day 32,400 are thought of as sleep, another 32,400 are thought of as working time, then there are 21,600 seconds of relaxation time. These groupings definitely don't feel like moments though, rather they're just a rough outline of the day. 

Let's focus on the work and relaxation parts of the day. Mark's day in work doesn't get off to a good start. He comes out of the bathroom and starts talking to Jenny - Mark *really* likes Jenny. They're talking awkwardly for a while and then he turns to head back to his desk. He takes a few steps when Jenny points out that there's a yard of toilet paper stuck to his shoe. 

After this he goes to a few meetings and has a quiet lunch reading a couple of chapters of his book. He's the lead on some design work so he spends the afternoon working on that. It's going really well, he's focused, creative and Jenny even gives him a compliment as she walks by his desk. 

But all of a sudden his computer freezes. He was so focused that he hasn't hit save for a while - autosave slows him down too much. Realising hours of work are on the line Mark gets very worried. He tries all the tricks he can think of to recover his work but eventually he angrily succumbs to the reality of the situation and turns his laptop off. As it restarts his temper boils over and he hits the screen. Everyone stares.

Mark takes some deep breaths and regains his nerve. He's able to quickly reproduce the work having already figured out most of the key design decisions. He leaves for home in a good headspace. When he arrives his flatmates have cooked dinner and afterwards they watch TV with a few beers. They happen on University Challenge and stare at the screen completely perplexed while starter and bonus questions spin by. Then

> 'In the darkening twilight I saw a lone star hover gem-like above the bay.' This was the last diary entry of which explorer, written on January 5th 1922 at Grytviken in South Georgia? 

_Shackleton_ murmurs Mark.

> Ernest Shackleton

> Correct!

Mark and his flatmates cheer victoriously!

The three main moments from Mark's day - good and bad -  are mapped out in the diagram above. In terms of actual time the toilet paper incident was actually 85 seconds long, Marks sulk about his computer crashing was over in 5 minutes and there was 15 seconds of cheering and smiling during that nice University Challenge moment. But Mark doesn't need to think about seconds cause he can just think of his day as three _moments_:

* Toilet Paper
* Hitting screen and sulking about losing work
* University Challenge

 These are a natural way to think about our days without being overwhelmed by time. They give a really simple picture in our heads of how the day went. So by removing all references to time we get a straight forward picture of the day.

## OCD Moments

So hopefully _this_ idea of moments is something you are familiar with or at least makes sense. An OCD moment is much like a normal moment in the sense that it is used as reference point when looking back on your day. A key difference is that it causes extreme anxiety, worry and fear.

OCD manifests itself in many ways. This varies from person to person and also, for the same person, might depend on the time of the day, year or life stage. For simplicity let's just look at one manifestation - **Checking**. This is a type of OCD characterised by a checking compulsion. People who suffer from this form of OCD feel an overwhelming anxiety that something bad has happened when carrying out ordinary day to day tasks. To counter this they feel the urge to check the situation so as to **reassure** themselves that nothing bad has happened. Some examples are:

* checking many times that a tap is off for fear of causing a flood. The tap is clearly off.
* looking in car mirrors to check that they did not cause an accident behind them. The person's driving was actually completely safe.

The crucial thing here is that the checking is a compulsion that temporarily gives relief from anxiety, however it is actually just reinforcing the notion that it is necessary at all.

(OCD-UK has a good description of the different types of OCD <a href="http://www.ocduk.org/types-ocd"> here</a> )

So suppose Mark suffers from checking OCD. He is terrified of prison and his OCD centers around the idea that he might someday accidentally commit a crime. This started last Christmas when he was out shopping with his parents. They were looking around an antique shop and Mark was bored. He was picking up pieces - watches, necklaces - to look at them and try his best to occupy himself. He was looking at a very pretty gold watch when suddenly his Dad tapped him on his shoulder.

> We're off son.

Mark jumped, looked around embarrassed and then ran after his parents as they left. A few shops later and he started feeling anxious. He couldn't remember putting the watch down when he left the shop. He checked all his pockets, his wrist and asked his Dad whether he saw him put it down. 

> I didn't see.

None of this makes the feeling go away. He started thinking back through the moment. 

>>> What was I thinking when Dad tapped my shoulder?....I can remember the feeling of it in my hand, but not leaving my hand....maybe I wanted to steel it? I might go to prison!....

The more Mark thought about it the more anxious he felt. Gradually over a few days he forgot about the whole incident. Until it happened again a few days later. And again a few days after that. Suddenly whenever Mark went into a shop he was terrified that he might accidentally steal something. This causes massive anxiety.

So let's insert an OCD moment into Mark's day described above and see what happens

<div align="center" >

</div>

At lunch Mark goes out to get a sandwich in the local shop. He's waiting to pay and decides to buy a Mars bar from the stand beside the queue. He picks one up. A loop of thoughts hit him

>>> Put it in your pocket....

He imagines putting it in his pocket. 

>>> Crap did I put it in my pocket?...

He is begging for the queue to move quicker - the sooner he pays the better. When he gets to the top he pays quickly - _for everything_ - and leaves the shop with the Mars bar in his hand. It's all a blur and a deep feeling saturates his mind - uncertainty and fear.

>>> I can't remember him scanning it. Can I remember handing it to him?....

He goes into a loop of checking, trying to remember the exact sequence of events as he paid. Every time he does this mental checking his distress increases and he just wants to check more.

>>> If only I'd asked for a receipt....maybe I should go back and ask.....but they'll think I'm weird....

He gets back into work and sits down at his desk.

>>> Can I remember handing it to him?....

>>> Maybe I didn't pay for it....I've let my whole family down....I'll lose my job....

>>> Did I put it in my pocket?...

>>> I'll go to prison...

>>> I can't remember him scanning it...

>>> I can't remember him scanning it...

>>> I can't remember him scanning it...

Work is a welcome distraction but the feeling remains with him for the rest of the day. The awful thing is that this drowns out any other moments.

Without this OCD moment Marks day had three moments all of which were quite important:

- Ultimately he had a really good chat with Jenny
- He was really proud of how he bounced back after his computer crashed
- University Challenge was a great moment with his friends

But now, with OCD, the second and third moments are obliterated by a vicious cycle of checking and anxiety. 

This isn't even Marks biggest problem. He is most concerned about when the next OCD moment will happen.
