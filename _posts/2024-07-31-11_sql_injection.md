Crow, sparrow and owl atop a tree, the tallest tree for miles, a nobly oak, snug in the crisp air.  

“It will take many weeks to fly such great distance and gather my haul. The most precious items I will hide and some I will save for you my friends. Your featherfone has all you need, just enter the code you agreed with me and fly to the secret locations that you see.”

\>>

The sun burned through the morning clouds. Owl could feel the heat on his gliding wings and as he approached the secret hiding place, he grew giddy thinking about what his friend Crow had left for him. 

A note. 

“Sorry Owl, I couldn’t resist…your friend Sparrow.”

\>>

Crow swooped down to the river and, gliding with the flow, he let his feet scratch the water. With the arches of a stone bridge approaching he gained speed and with a deep breath rotated his wings and gave three big flaps to shoot upwards towards a gap in the limestone rock. Shillings, rattles, CDs all hidden in this precious space. 

No, a note. 

“Sorry Crow. Make sure to quote stings next time. Or even better use a parametrised query. In fact just use an ORM. Or next time don’t bother with the API and just send the locations over WhatsApp, that’s much simpler, no need for the API at all really.  Your friend Sparrow”
